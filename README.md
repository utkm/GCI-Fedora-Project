# GCI-Fedora-Project

_Google Code-In 2019:_
In this GCI Task by Fedora Project, we were tasked to create a very simple program that returns the number of divisors a number has in a given range.

Examples:
1. input: 5, output: 5 is divisible by 2 numbers
2. input: 10, output: 10 is divisible by 4 numbers


I chose to complete this using Python and list comprehensions. For every divisor in a specified range, an item was appended to an existing list. At the end of the program, I simply returned the number of items in the list. 
Thanks for checking it out!
